The Fallacy of Possibility
--------------------------

`<rant>`

This fella here spent two sprints of his time and an equal amount of his employer's money shimming configurable colors into the inline CSS of his ~~stupid-ass~~ mobile app because there were three snowflakes commented in the Play store that there was no dark theme, which is oh-so-19<super>th</super>-century; one of them even said something about "visual impairment". Very nice. Oh how sweet. You know who doesn't stand a chance using your stupid-ass app?

People without a smartphone!

**Build. A. Fucking Website.**

Here's another one - wait for it, this blew my mind:

My mate: \*Explains difficulty he faced with the website*  
Reception lady: Oh, no, don't use the website, we recommend installing the app.  
My mate: Why are you guys not improving the website?!  
Lady: Because we received feedback that the app is better.

When something is doable in a specific set of strict conditions... Monzo got a **+** from me initially thanks to the friction points they eliminated (or seeked to), but they mis-assumed that they needed to do every single thing differently. Then ehy messed up at a time when they weren't the single coolest tool in the shed anymore.


Some dependencies in the world today are absolutely bonkers. For example: getting good customer support from a bank (alt: a bank with good customer support) requires a touch-screen device. Getting paid for some work you've done requires an address.

According to whatever streetside stats I was able to find in between rants, there are more people in the world who don't have a smartphone than there are people who, assuming they had one, would have difficulty or impossibility using it due to visual impairment.

We (read: techies, developers, hackers, nerds etc) don't realise how opinionated a platform smartphone apps are, but we're the ones building the next bank, the next electric car, the next fun fare experience, the next mass transit system... not the unemployed man in the street who can't get paid for a bricklaying job without KYC. It seems to our tiny minds that 
and/; whenever we do take it seriously it's from the wrong angle: making accommodations for fonts, zoom, color schemes... but not realising we're bound by one fundamental restriction

Let's imagine for a moment a superfuturistic nerd club running from a dilapidated sports hall deliberately decorated to look like a mother's mega-basement, who are developing a VR mode for a distributed cryptocurrency exchange one of them wrote one Saturday afternoon when he was high. Very cool. Placing advanced exchange charts next to each other in 3D instead of on top of each other and 
A crypto exchange in beta requiring a VR rig

But I'm not the goal here, because I'm approximately indistinguishable from the average man in the street; instead, a big investor, whose nerdy child within hasn't been totally squelched by the businessman adult, happens by, and with a swift stroke of a pen (or checkbox on a screen, more likely) buys the whole thing and releases it on the internet as a working beta. The original nerds, sedated by their sudden wealth, forget to include a way to toggle off the VR mode in the latest shippable, and instead hide somewhere and blow the money on Domino's pizza and Tesco's finest lager.

So now we have a cryptocurrency exchange which truly solves the problem of distributed cryptocurrency exchange, but it requires a VR rig to run, and because it's the future and fiat currencies are going to shit you have to spend the last of it on a VR rig today if you are to be able to function in society tomorrow.

That's approximately how the middle-aged ladies who were complaining about customer support outside their bank 15 years ago would have felt if you told them that problem will be solved swiftly but would require a touch-screen device.



I'm sure I've seen slogans somewhere about "building the bank for everyone", quickly followed by "download our app to get started". Whoever thought that was a good marketing move?! 


Maybe you think I'm arguing from a moot point because, after all, there are still brick-and-mortar banks one can walk into, and after all, this gap in smartphone penetration won't last many more years. Maybe you think the governments can magic some money out of their asses like they always do and buy some bottom-of-the-barrel devices from the lowest bidder, which can't run the settings app without lag, and give them to the people who can't afford them for nothing.

But that's not the point.

Rather, the point is that _I do not wish_ to install your stupid app. _I do not wish_ to depend on a global duopoly unaccountable to anyone thanks to its incomprehensible amount of money. _I do not wish_ for you to

Build a fucking website.

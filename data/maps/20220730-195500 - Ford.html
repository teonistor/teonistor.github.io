			If you want to transplant this map into another Web page, by far the best method is to
			simply include it in a IFRAME tag (see https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/faq.html#google_html).
			But, if you must paste the code into another page, be sure to include all of these parts:
			   1. The "div" tags that contain the map and its widgets, below
			   2. Three sections of JavaScript code:
			      a. The API code (from googleapis.com or unpkg.com/leaflet), above
			      b. "gv_options" and the code that calls a .js file on gpsvisualizer.com
			      c. The "GV_Map" function, which contains all the geographic info for the map

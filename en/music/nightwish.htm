<h2>Symphonic metal for the non-metalheads</h2>
<p>You said you don't know shit about Nightwish. You said you're not into metal music.</p>
<p>Good for you.</p>
<p>I said I would introduce you to the less metallic side of this band, because metal is not just about ear-screechy voices and rusty guitar strings (I don't like those either really). So let's start with this piece from their latest studio album (as of August 2017), which has been playing on repeat in my head all day today without my explicit permission: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mELUOFjf7ys">Our decades in the sun</a> | <a href="http://nightwish.com/en/lyrics/endless-forms-most-beautiful/our-decades-in-the-sun">lyrics</a> (pardon the unofficial video).</p>
<p>Still in the soft realm, an old song in a new, live interpretation: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsotlzr9wNw">Sleeping sun</a>. Also, the original, studio version: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGfKMV5AbMI">Sleeping sun</a>.</p>
<p>Because I like time travelling I will jump back to the most recent album: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPonioDYnoY">Ã‰lan</a> | <a href="http://nightwish.com/en/lyrics/endless-forms-most-beautiful/elan">lyrics</a>.</p>
<p>Let's speed up the business a tad more and listen to what has become one of the anthems of the Hillwalking Society: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8gXzDLNWl8">Over the hills and far away</a></p>
<p>Now we're getting serious! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIBdpFJyFkc">Nemo</a></p>
<p>If you reached this far, I advise that you proceed with caution. Only if following the scrutiny of the songs above you believe you have the time and balls for some more and heavier action should you listen to the next 3 masterpieces, in no particulat order. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYjIlHWBAVo">Ghost love score</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3ntHpYocc0">The poet and the pendulum</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n499M4pgc5o&t=1s">The greatest show on Earth</a></p>
<p style="font-style: oblique">Order only exists because my thoughts are exposed as text, and human text is an array of letters, and arrays have an intrinsic order.</p>

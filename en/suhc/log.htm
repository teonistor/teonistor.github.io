<h2>SUHC Captain's Log</h2>

<P>I have been appointed Day Walk Secretary of SUHC in March 2017. I am (attempting to) keep a record of our activities and stats and trivia about them, which you can see below. (If you can see at all. I really hope you do.) Hopefully before the end of the year an improved website of the club will come into existence and this content will be migrated there.</P>

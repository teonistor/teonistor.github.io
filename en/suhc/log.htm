<h2>SUHC Captain's Log</h2>

<P>I have been appointed Day Walk Secretary of SUHC in March 2017. At the time of writing this text, I have yet to become non-rubbish at this job. However (and to this end), I will (attempt to) keep a record of our walks and stats and trivia about them, which you can see below. (If you can see at all. I really hope you do.)</P>

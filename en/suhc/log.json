Whilst going up a hill, minibus 3 starts to get clutch problems. Minibus 2 makes it up the hill, minibus 3 decides clutch is fucked, hill ahead is far too steep, try and turn around. Through some witchcraft, minibus 3 ends up with front against a stone wall and rear wheels stuck in mud. After adding stones to try and provide extra traction and not succeeding, minibus 2 is despatched to the bottom of the hill to collect 3’s passengers. Minibus 3’s passengers hike 1km to minibus 2 and get back to bunkhouses safely. Minibus 3 is now left stranded awaiting assistance. After a very long wait, and a lack of decent communication from the RAC, the recovery vehicle arrives. Defender 90 equipped with winch, snorkel, and all manner of gadgets in the back. After a failed attempt with traction mats, and a failed attempt to squeeze the defender around the rear of the minibus, we begin to debate the feasibility of winching the minibus to a straightened orientation. After this turns out to be futile without damaging the fence, wall or minibus, metal traction ladders are brought into play. These prove to be more effective and with the aid of 4 people pushing from the front, the minibus finally finds some grip. Under direction of the recovery guy, the minibus is eventually orientated to face up the hill, paper work is filled in and we make a move. Clutch is still dodgy but we just about make it up the hill!"

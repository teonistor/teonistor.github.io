<h2>Anatomy of Zoom</h2>
<hr>
<p>
  Centuries ago, we were pointing our bulky telescopes at the night sky, overwhelmed by curiosity and wonder. How we managed to even have the idea to build such monuments of glass and metal beats me, but we were zooming into the unknown, in hope of finding answers to questions we were yet to ask.

  Much like we are still doing today. Except today we all know what a camera is. As much as we respect (and occasionally pay for) the professional photographer, who carries his almighty (and quite heavy!) cylinder of lenses to posh events, we have our little cameras around us all over the place. The photographer carefully turns his lenses before each snapshot, fine tuning zoom, focus, aperture, and whatnot, while we use two fingers on a screen to digitally zoom into the distance, relying on autofocus. But the effect is quite the same, although our digital zoom would cause the photo to rapidly decrease in quality and become useless were it not for the high resolution cameras that are so commonplace nowadays.

  It is perhaps disconcerting that when screens first started to "zoom" they did so in complete ignorance of what "zoom" should mean; or rather, people reused the word abusively. Somehow somebody had the idea that zooming on a computer screen should affect the sizes of each object independently, and said objects are to keep their relative positions but not quite, ensuring they remain within view even when zooming in, except of course when there is physically insufficient space on screen, in which case they hide below the bottom and only the bottom, because everybody loves scrolling down, but never in the other 3 directions. Zoom in on any website without fancy setup on any desktop computer and you'll know what I mean... text gets bigger but crams in and flies about on the page.

  But that's so wrong I'm having a hard time imagining why anyone ever had the idea to call these two concepts the same word. It's like changing the font size in a document from 10 to 14 and saying you just zoomed in from 100% to 140%.

  Then came devices with touch screens and the meaning of "zoom" suffered a plot twist. View the same website on a phone and zooming in works much like on a picture, without all the content distorsion. Could it be because touch-screen phones also introduced two-finger zoom on actual pictures, and on the camera?...

  Before throwing this website at the world, I had tested it extensively. Or so I thought, not realising the "responsive" buzzword needs to be paid at least a few seconds of attention. I was profoundly appalled the day I accessed my own website from my own mobile phone, and the text was so tiny I really could only read it because I already knew what it was. My phone is not exactly small, but even turning it landscape improved the situation too little. "But of course, I can zoom!" thought I, struck by the sudden false wisdom. Unfortunately, zooming on a phone makes things larger, but you must move around to see them all. The text became readable, but I had to scroll left and right to reach the ends of the lines, which were now a few times longer than my whole screen. User experience on the website was downright maddening. "Gosh, I could really use the wrong concept of zoom right now," thought I, as I fell into despair.

  Luckily, it was my own website, so I could fix it right away; and the fix was shamefully simple. My moments of despair didn't last.

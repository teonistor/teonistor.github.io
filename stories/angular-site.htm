  I had a job once.

<p>
  Well, I had several. They had all been dead boring until this one. Either by achievement or by curse, I ended up working for one of those huge multinational organisations that make my few paranoid friends and relatives warn me that I had sold my soul to the devil.

  I was thrown into a large ongoing project and soon threw myself into a couple others on the side. Most of my prior technical knowledge, the particulars of which had been assessed in great detail before admittance, was about as good as a wax key forgotten in the sunshine. We were working on this web-based tool which was using all kinds of technologies and idioms I knew too little about. One of them was Angular JS, this mighty piece of code that runs in anyone's browser and lets you build single-page websites with a wide range of bells and whistles, most of which you will not see here. I had to hack my way through and do things wrong which looked right; but in the end "learning by doing" is the best way of learning. It would sound like an excerpt from a cheap romantic comedy if I were to say I fell in love with Angular JS and web development tools, and it would be an exaggeration; let's just say I wanted to apply my newly acquired skills some more, and so I rebuilt this website into what you can see today. What it was before, you are lucky to never have seen.

  A mini-crisis struck a team in my line of business once. It was the kind of crisis that all employees blame on senior management, but the senior manager is the only one being correct in blaming on the employees, who had overestimated their abilities. Somehow a team in India was left with no option but to employ two juniors from the UK to do their business, one of whom was I. Working with the Indian team was difficult, as it implied coming to the office one hour early to catch their time zone; and most of them also had a most undecipherable accent. But I swore to myself, for every minute I came in early I would leave a minute early in the next days. And so I did, in spite of everybody around me, who seemed to notice my leaving at 16:55 instead of 17:00 much more loudly and prominently than they had my arriving at 8:05 instead of 9:00.

  Turns out I didn't sell my soul to anybody; at least not yet.
